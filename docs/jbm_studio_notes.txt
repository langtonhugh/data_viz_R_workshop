Notes from John Burn-Murdoch presentation rstudio::global 2021.

- Data visualisation fundamentally is an act of communication.
- To CREATE effective, powerful charts, you have to understand how people CONSUME charts.
- How can we design the chart so that people understand, enjoy and remember the visual?
- Not everyone is a chart person!
- In many ways, a chart is an advert. 
- If you've conducted lots of data handling and analysis to answer a research question, surely
  you want to convey this information and tell the story in a way that people will understanding,
  enjoy and remember!
- Of course, the chart should be accurate, but you are COMMUNICATING! It's not JUST about
  objectivity and precision.
