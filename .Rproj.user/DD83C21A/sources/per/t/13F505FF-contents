## Preamble

The page contains the course material for a workshop hosted jointly between the [University of Manchester](https://www.methods.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/). All material and associated scripts are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/langtonhugh/data_viz_workshop).

## Background

This morning we covered data visualisation in R using `ggplot2`, a graphics package based on the [grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) which is fully integrated into the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). By now you will have a solid understanding of how to build graphics using the package. Fortunately, due to the integration of spatial packages in R and ggplot, the step from making standard graphics to making spatial visualisations (e.g. thematic maps) is a small one. We'll be making use of exactly the same skills you picked up earlier, but with spatial data.

One of the fastest growing packages in this area is [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf), which gives you access to a whole host of features and functions for use with spatial data, including visualisation. There is a highly comprehensive book available [online](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/), written by the creators, which details sf and its uses in detail. If you are interested in taking spatial data further after this course, that book is the way to go!

The package has complete functionality within ggplot through an additional geometry `geom_sf()` which becomes available once you've installed and loaded `sf`. Do that now using the `install.packages()` and `library()` respectively.
